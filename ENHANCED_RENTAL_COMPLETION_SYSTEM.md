# Enhanced Rental Completion System

## Overview

The enhanced rental completion system ensures that products only become available for rent again after both the owner and renter confirm the rental completion. This prevents premature product availability and ensures both parties agree that the rental has been completed successfully.

## Key Features

### 1. Dual Confirmation Requirement
- Both the product owner and renter must confirm completion
- Products remain unavailable until both parties confirm
- Automatic status updates when both confirmations are received

### 2. New Rental Status: `pending_completion_confirmation`
- Intermediate status between `active` and `completed`
- Tracks individual confirmation status for both parties
- Shows confirmation progress to users

### 3. Enhanced Product Availability Logic
- Products are filtered out of available listings when in active rental
- Products become available again only after both parties confirm completion
- Real-time updates across the platform

## Implementation Details

### Rental Status Flow

1. **Active Rental** (`active`)
   - Product is currently being rented
   - Product is not available for new rentals

2. **Initiate Completion** (`pending_completion_confirmation`)
   - Either party can initiate the completion process
   - Confirmation flags are reset
   - Product remains unavailable

3. **Confirmation Process**
   - Owner confirms completion
   - Renter confirms completion
   - Both confirmations are tracked separately

4. **Completed** (`completed`)
   - Both parties have confirmed
   - Product becomes available for rent again
   - Rental history is updated
