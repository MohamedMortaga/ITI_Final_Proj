# Rental Status Enhancement

## Problem Solved

1. **Contact Information Disappearing**: Contact information was disappearing when rental status changed from 'pending' to 'active'
2. **Missing Renter Controls**: Renters had no way to confirm they received items or mark rentals as completed
3. **Limited Status Management**: Only sellers could update rental status

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed ContactDetails.vue Filtering

**Issue**: Contact information was filtered out for non-pending statuses
**Fix**: Updated filtering to include all relevant statuses

```javascript
// Before: Only showed pending, active, completed
const bookingsWithRenterInfo = sellerBookings.filter((booking) => 
  booking.userName && booking.phoneNumber && ['pending', 'active', 'completed'].includes(booking.status)
);

// After: Includes rejected status as well
const bookingsWithRenterInfo = sellerBookings.filter((booking) => 
  booking.userName && booking.phoneNumber && ['pending', 'active', 'completed', 'rejected'].includes(booking.status)
);
```

### 2. Enhanced MyRentals.vue with Status Management

**Added rental status management section** to MyRentals.vue with:

- **Current Status Display**: Shows the current rental status
- **Status Update Buttons**: Allow renters to update rental status
- **Status History**: Shows recent status changes
- **Conditional Buttons**: Different buttons based on current status

#### Available Renter Actions:

1. **Confirm Received** (pending → active)
   - Button: "Confirm Received"
   - When: Status is 'pending'
   - Action: Confirms the renter has received the item

2. **Mark Completed** (active → completed)
   - Button: "Mark Completed"
   - When: Status is 'active'
   - Action: Marks the rental as completed when returning item

3. **Reject Rental** (pending → rejected)
   - Button: "Reject Rental"
   - When: Status is 'pending'
   - Action: Rejects the rental

4. **Reset to Pending** (rejected → pending)
   - Button: "Reset to Pending"
   - When: Status is 'rejected'
   - Action: Resets status back to pending

### 3. Updated Translation Keys

**Added new translation keys** to both English and Arabic locale files:

```json
{
  "confirmReceived": "Confirm Received",
  "markCompleted": "Mark Completed"
}
```

Arabic translations:
```json
{
  "confirmReceived": "تأكيد الاستلام",
  "markCompleted": "تحديد كمكتمل"
}
```

### 4. Enhanced User Experience

#### For Sellers (ContactDetails.vue):

- Full status history tracking

#### For Renters (MyRentals.vue):

### 5. Status Flow

```
