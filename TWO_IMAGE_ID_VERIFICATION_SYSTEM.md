# Two-Image ID Verification System

## Overview

The enhanced ID verification system now supports uploading both front and back images of ID cards, providing a more comprehensive verification process. This system ensures that users must upload both sides of their ID card before they can submit for verification, and admins can review both images before approving or rejecting the verification.

## Key Features

### User Features
- **Two-Image Upload**: Users must upload both front and back images of their ID card
- **Separate Upload Areas**: Clear distinction between front and back ID upload sections
- **Real-time Preview**: Users can see uploaded images immediately
- **Replace Functionality**: Users can replace individual images if needed
- **Submit for Review**: Users can only submit for verification when both images are uploaded
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time status updates (not uploaded, pending, approved, rejected)

### Admin Features
- **Dual Image Review**: Admins can view both front and back ID images
- **Image Selection Modal**: Choose which image to view in full screen
- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: Statistics and management interface
- **Approval/Rejection Process**: Full workflow with reason tracking
- **User Management**: Integration with user verification status

## Database Structure

### User Verifications Collection (`user-verifications`)
```javascript
{
  userId: "string",
  frontIdCardUrl: "string",        // Front ID image URL
  backIdCardUrl: "string",         // Back ID image URL
  frontFileName: "string",         // Front image filename
  backFileName: "string",          // Back image filename
  frontFileSize: "number",         // Front image file size
  backFileSize: "number",          // Back image file size
  uploadedAt: "timestamp",         // Upload timestamp
  submittedAt: "timestamp",        // Submission timestamp
  status: "string",                // null, 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected'
  reviewedAt: "timestamp",         // Review timestamp
  reviewedBy: "string",            // Admin who reviewed
  rejectionReason: "string"        // Reason for rejection
}
```

### Users Collection (Updated)
```javascript
{
  // ... existing user fields
  isVerified: "boolean",           // User verification status
  verifiedAt: "timestamp"          // Verification timestamp
}
```

## Implementation Details

### User Upload Process
1. **Front ID Upload**: User uploads front image of ID card
2. **Back ID Upload**: User uploads back image of ID card
3. **Validation**: Both images must be valid image files (JPG, PNG, WebP)
4. **File Size Check**: Maximum 5MB per image
5. **Submit for Review**: User submits both images for admin review
6. **Status Update**: Status changes to 'pending'

### Admin Review Process
1. **Dashboard View**: Admin sees all verification requests
2. **Image Review**: Admin can view both front and back images
3. **Decision**: Admin approves or rejects with reason
4. **User Update**: User verification status is updated accordingly
5. **Notification**: User receives notification of decision

### File Storage
- **Front Images**: `id-cards/{userId}/front/{timestamp}-{filename}`
- **Back Images**: `id-cards/{userId}/back/{timestamp}-{filename}`
- **Security**: Images are stored securely in Firebase Storage

## User Experience Flow

### New User Flow
1. User navigates to Profile → ID Verification
2. User uploads front ID image
3. User uploads back ID image
4. User clicks "Submit for Verification"
5. Status changes to "Pending"
6. User waits for admin review

### Admin Review Flow
1. Admin navigates to Admin → ID Verifications
2. Admin views pending verifications
3. Admin clicks "View ID Card" to see images
4. Admin chooses to view front or back image
5. Admin approves or rejects verification
6. User receives notification of decision

## Security Features

### File Validation
- **Type Check**: Only image files (JPG, PNG, WebP) accepted
- **Size Limit**: Maximum 5MB per image
- **Virus Scan**: Files are scanned for malicious content

### Access Control
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own verification data
- **Admin Authorization**: Only admins can review and approve verifications
- **Secure Storage**: Images stored with proper access controls

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Privacy**: ID information used only for verification purposes
- **Retention**: Data retention policies in place

## Integration Points

### Booking System
- Users cannot make bookings without verified ID
- System checks `user.isVerified` before allowing bookings
- Redirects unverified users to ID verification page

### Product Creation
- Users cannot add products without verified ID
- System checks `user.isVerified` before allowing product creation
- Redirects unverified users to ID verification page

### Notification System
- Automatic notifications when verifications are submitted
- Notifications when verifications are approved/rejected
- Email and in-app notifications supported

## Error Handling

### Upload Errors
- File type validation errors
- File size limit errors
- Network upload errors
- Storage quota errors

### Processing Errors
- Database connection errors

## Configuration

### Firebase Storage Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /id-cards/{userId}/{type}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
        (request.auth.uid == userId || 
         get(/databases/$(firestore.default)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin');
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### Firestore Security Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /user-verifications/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        (request.auth.uid == userId || 
         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin');
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
